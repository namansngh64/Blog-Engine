# Blog-Engine

This is a Web App where a registered user can create, edit, delete and comment on blogs.

Not registered users can only read the blogs posted.

I have used the concept of token rotation for increased security.

Made using MERN Stack

projbackend- Contains all the backend files(nodejs,expressjs and mongodb)

projfrontend- Contains all the frontend files(reactjs)

First do --- npm install --- to install all the dependencies(First delete node modules folder if exists already)

Then run --- npm start --- in both projbackend and projfrontend with different instances of cmd to run the project

Also configure .env file according to your path and need or just hard code the values in code(not recommended)
